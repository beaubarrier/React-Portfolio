                <p>   I was born in the great state of New Jersey. I lived in New Jersey for 23 years before moving to Austin
                    Texas to work
                    for Apple Inc. I spent seven years with Apple before leaving to take on a roll as lead desiner for High
                    Impact Printing.</p>

                <p> There I designed billboards for clients such as Ashley Furniture. After two years in that roll I moved
                    to California to
                    chase my dreams. </p>

                <p>  I have a beautiful two year old daughter and I love the nature and vibe of California.</p>
