                <p>   I was born in the great state of new jersey. I lived in new jersey for 23 years before moving to austin
                    texas to work
                    for apple inc. I spent seven years with apple before leaving to take on a roll as lead desiner for high
                    impact printing.</p>

                <p> there I designed billboards for clients such as ashley furniture. after two years in that roll I moved
                    to california to
                    chase my dreams. </p>

                <p>  i have a beautiful two year old daughter and I love the nature and vibe of california.</p>
