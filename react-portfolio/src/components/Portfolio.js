                <div id="hide">    I was born in the great state of new jersey. I lived in new jersey for 23 years before moving to austin
                    texas to work
                    for apple inc. I spent seven years with apple before leaving to take on a roll as lead desiner for high
                    impact printing.

                    <p> there I designed billboards for clients such as ashley furniture. after two years in that roll I moved
                        to california to
                        chase my dreams. </p>

                    <p>  i have a beautiful two year old daughter and I love the nature and vibe of california.</p></div>
